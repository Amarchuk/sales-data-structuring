# Sales data restructuring

Clean the raw data to a visualizable format.

## Getting Started

Clone this project to use.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python3.5 to run the project.

```
python3 sales_forecast.py
```

### Installing

Get the following raw data files following this naming convention, put them next to the sales_forcaster.py file:
```
INVENTORY... February YYYY ... .csv
ORDERS... .csv
SALESPERDAY... .xlsx
```

Get the input file following this naming convention, put them next to the sales_forcaster.py file:
```
...input.xlsx
```
By default, the script uses the input file if found. If it is not found then tries to download from Google Sheets.

*Using Google Sheets*: 

Copy the local.env file and rename it to .env
Fill the ids for the input and calculations google sheets for development:

```
INPUT_SPREADSHEET_ID=''
CALCULATIONS_SPREADSHEET_ID=''
```
